Input:

      CPDL takes a multiple alignment as input, in which two homologous
      groups of proteins have been arranged such that all the members of
      one group are in rows 1 to n, and all the members of the 2nd group
      are in rows n+1 and below.  The number n must be specified on the 
      command line to demarcate the two groups.

      The input aligment format is text, one protein per line, where
      each line consists of three whitespace-separated fields: 
                   <seqnum> <seqname> <seq>
      where
         <seqnum>  is an increasing integer 
         <seqname> is a sequence identifier 
         <seq>     is the protein amino acid sequence, as it apears in
                   the alignment, where inserted spaces are indicated by
                   '.' (period character).  Amino acids should be all caps
                   and can include 'X' (which is treated the same as '.')
         no spaces can occur in any of these fields. 

      example input

      1 MURE_XANAC .....................MSRSMALS.......QLLPDVALTHDVQVSGLVMDSRA
      2 MURE_XANCP .....................MSRAMALS.......QLLPDVALARDVQVSGLVMDSRA
      3 MURE_ECOLI ......................ADRNLRD.......LLAPWVPDAPSRALREMTLDSRV
      4 MURE_AGRT5 .....................MNLRDISGNAFP..ELKELLLSEIGAIEIGGITADSRK
      5 MURE_RHIME .....................MKITDLAGSNFP..ELSAQLKGDAATIEIGGITADSRQ
      6 MURE_BRUSU .....................MKLKEIA.......LFNELASGEAGEVEITGITSDSRA

      Two scripts, aln2cal and msf2cal, are provided to translate CLUSTAL .aln
      format files and MSF format files into CPDL input.

      (Strictly speaking, <seqnum> and <seqname> are not used by CPDL;
      they were included in the output of the front-end translator programs
      to help with manual checking)


CPDL Options:

    cpdl.pl [<options>] <n> [<input-file>]

    <n> must be specified.  If <input-file> file not specified, stdin is
    scanned.


    -g exponential  (default)
    -g linear
    -g plateau
           use exponential, linear or flat gamma-correction functions
           to indicate lower frequency residues or properties.
           The "plateau" function always indicates conserved residues
           or properties with bold or dark.

    -C unanimous_minus_1 (default)
    -C unanimous  
           define "conserved" to be "All but one" or "all"

    -d <n>  (default 0.25)
           numeric factor to control darkness of output

    -f <n> (default 5)
           frequency cutoff for printing - don't print any more than
           this number of residues/property symbols in the tracks -

    -t <str>
           use <str> as plot title (default is filename)

    -P 
           don't display orange circles (which indicate differences in 
           property tracks) in the main track 
 
    -K   
           don't display key table at end of output

    -U  
           don't print user's settings at end of output

   The following options control the various property track display states:

    -s <state>  
           size track
    -w <state>
           hydrophobicity track
    -c <state>
           charge track
    -p <state>
           polarity track
    -a <state>
           aromaticity track

    where  <state> can be one of the following:

           blank           don't show the track
           on              show every position in the track
           discrep         only show position if there's a difference (default)
           main_discrep    only show position if there's a difference in the
                           main track
           main_full_high  only show position if there's a "full-high" 
                           (red hourglass) difference in the main track

     The main track (residue) state is always 'on' and can't be changed.


Output:

       See the publication in Bioinformatics for a detailed description of
       the graphics output.

       CPDL produces Postscript graphics output, which may be sent directly to 
       a postscript printer or displayed with programs such as ghostscript, 
       ghostview, or Preview (MacOSX).  Postscript can also be converted into
       PDF format via ps2pdf or pstopdf.  Ghostscript is also capable of 
       converting the output into a number of different graphics formats.


Examples:
       
            aln2cal MurE_D.aln >MurE_D.cal
            cpdl.pl 25 MurE_D.cal >mured1.ps

       or front-end output can be piped directly into cpdl.pl input:

            aln2cal MurE_D.aln | cpdl.pl 25 | gs

       use a "plateau" gamma correction and convert output to PDF
    
            msf2cal cyclases.msf | cpdl.pl -g plateau 20 | ps2pdf >cyclases.pdf
